        <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, we were completely
          shocked when we got to know that we’ve won the first prize in our Inter School debate on environmental
          pollution. It was the second time when we participated in debate competition. At the time when we participated
          for the very first time so we didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time we felt a little
          sad but we
          decided that we’d do more hard work and we will participate again and I guess that we took the right decision
          to participate again, Also we learnt that hard work always pays off because At our first participation, we
          were
          not concerned towards this competition but when we faced failure then It inspired us to do more hard work and
          because of that we have gotten this prize, Our parents were very proud of us. We have known that hard work is
          most important to achieve success.

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">The food option and responsibities to
        consider,canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with
        photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents
        make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provieded
        with a School Canteen Account on the School website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any
        dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate
        all the fuss of money handling it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
        Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accuracy
      Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
      management System ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data
      entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
      <br><br>
      2. Economices
      Have you ever thought that attendance management Systems could costs? It saves money by putting an end to
      inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tradiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of
      fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after
      implementing automated attendance management Systems.
      <br><br>
      3. productivity / Efficiency
      Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes
      time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create
      payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from
      keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing into your payroll system. The time and
      effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resorces which lead to increased
      productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / Insights, Massle Free Workflow Managemeent,
